# API Testing using SuperTest, Mocha and Chai

## What is it all about Supertest?

To introduce `SuperTest`, it is a high level abstraction of HTTP requests, making it perfect for testing APIs. More info can be explored in https://www.npmjs.com/  

## Getting Started:

You need to have the following installed in your machine:

1. Node (Latest Version).
2. npm(Latest Version).
3. `mocha` framework is used for writing tests and `chai` for assertions, following command should help to install the required npm packages:
   `npm i -D -g supertest mocha chai mochawesome`
4. For running the tests, you need to type the command: `npm run test`. _(Check Package.json for more details)_
5. For generating the mochawesome report, run the command `npm run report` _(Check Package.json for more details.)_ It will generate and export the report in `mochawesome-report` folder from which you can open the `index.html` file to view the report.

## Talking more about the Scenarios Covered in this project:

- [Mochawesome reporter][mochawesome-wevbsite] is used to generate the reports and show summary of the tests. Its quite useful report as it shows the test description along with the tests and the time taken to run the tests.
